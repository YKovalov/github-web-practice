    What is Lorem Ipsum?
    <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
    industry's
    standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a
    type
    specimen book.

    <!-- <p> tag stands for paragraph -->

    <p>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
        essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
    </p>

    <h1>Where does it come from?</h1>
    <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin
        literature
        from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College.</p>

    <h2>Where can I get some?</h2>
    <p>Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and
        Evil)
        by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise.
    </p>

    <h3>Why do we use it?</h3>
    <p>The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
